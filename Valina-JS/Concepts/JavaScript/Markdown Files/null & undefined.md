# null & undefined

```javascript
let a = null;
let b = undefined;

console.log(a); // null
console.log(b); // undefined
```

`null` means an empty or non-existent value. 

`null` is assigned, and explicitly means nothing.

`undefined` means a variable has been declared, but the value of that variable has not ye been defined.
