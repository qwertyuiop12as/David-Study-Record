Nowadays, we can easily see many restaurants. And there are many types of menu or style for them. As restaurants became a common place to eat meal, many people visit restaurant and for some families, they choose regular days to eat meals ar restaurants. I also prefer to eat meals at restaurants than eat meals at my home.

First, we don't have to clean our house after eat meals. When we go to restaurants, we can just order menus, eat them, and leave. It is really easy compare to eat meal at home because there is no dishes to clean.

Second, we can try many different types of foods when we eat meals at restaurants. It is hard to make many types of dishes in home because of many reasons such as time or ingredient. But when we eat meals at restaurants, they provide several types of menus for us to chose and eat. 

Because I don't have to clean our home and I can try several types of meals, I prefer to eat meals at restaurants instead of prepare and eat food in my home.
